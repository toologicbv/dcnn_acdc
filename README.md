## Bayesian DCNN and SliceDetector (PyTorch 0.4.0)
The Bayesian DCNN is not changed, except it was upgraded to pytorch 0.4.0 version. The SliceDetector VGG like network with SPP layer worked in a preliminary version. Dataset creation does not take into account unbalanced classes (degenerate versus non-degenerate slices).
