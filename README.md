## SliceDetector (PyTorch 0.4.0)
Working on a detector than can identify cardiac mri slices with dice score below a certain predefined threshold that could be then referred to a medical expert. Using results of Bayesian DCNN on ACDC dataset as input to the detector network which is a VGG like network with spatial pyramid pooling layer to enable processing of input slices of different sizes.
