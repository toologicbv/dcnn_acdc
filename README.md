## Slice eferral version2
Previous slice referral version was based on a slice u-value that we obtained by filtering large connected areas in a slice.
In this version we attempt to build a 2D histogram for each slice and hopefully compute a 2D entropy measure per slice 
on which we're able to refer/filter slices.
